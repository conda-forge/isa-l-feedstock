    ISA-L is a collection of optimized low-level functions targeting storage applications. ISA-L includes:
    Erasure codes - Fast block Reed-Solomon type erasure codes for any encode/decode matrix in GF(2^8).
    CRC - Fast implementations of cyclic redundancy check. Six different polynomials supported.
        iscsi32, ieee32, t10dif, ecma64, iso64, jones64.
    Raid - calculate and operate on XOR and P+Q parity found in common RAID implementations.
    Compression - Fast deflate-compatible data compression.
    De-compression - Fast inflate-compatible data compression.
    This package includes the igzip program on Linux and MacOS.
